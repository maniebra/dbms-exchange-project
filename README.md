## Phase 1

### Description

In phase 1, we were required to draw some ERDs using [draw.io](https://draw.io) and provide answers to some relational algebra problems.

### Task list

Our team's task list can be viewed at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1Guh4HTWLyG9GTomZEtesp5cjIGez9m9Day3bS_kgM/edit?usp=sharing).

### Documentation

The documentation for the first phase is available at [`./Phase1/Documentation/main.pdf`](https://github.com/maniebra/dbms-exchange-project/blob/main/Phase1/Documentations/main.pdf)

## Phase 2

### Task list

Since this phase was more straightforward, creating a task list like the one in the last phase was considered obsolete. Here are the tasks that each person handled:

- Mohammad Jafaripour: Documentation, API Endpoints, Normalization, and Seedings
- Mohammad Amin Heidari: Normalization, Seedings
- Mani Ebrahimi: SQL queries and assisting in documentation
